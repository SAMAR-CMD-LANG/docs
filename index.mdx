# Welcome to the Samantha API

The Samantha API powers the features behind **mysamantha.ai**, your intelligent personal assistant for managing notes, tasks, journals, reminders, analytics, and more.

This documentation will help you understand how Samantha organizes your data and how each feature interacts behind the scenes.  
It is intended for users who want to view, manage, or integrate their Samantha data programmatically.  
This is **not** a platform for building full third-party apps — instead, it gives you controlled, authenticated access to your Samantha account’s data.
