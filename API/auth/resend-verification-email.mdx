- The previous verification link expired

# 📘 Notes

- This endpoint does **not** verify the user; it only resends the verification link.  
- The verification email typically contains a token used in `/auth/verify-email/`.  
- Good UX: Show “Email Sent” regardless of whether the account exists (optional).
