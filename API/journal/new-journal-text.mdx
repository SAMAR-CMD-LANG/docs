**POST** `/journals/{date}/`

This endpoint creates a **new journal entry** for the specified date.  
Only the authenticated user can create journal entries.

If a journal already exists for that date, the backend may update or overwrite it depending on the server logic.

This version accepts **text-only** journal entries (no attachments).
